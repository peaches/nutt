## Firewood

Whether you are looking for firewood to heat your home or to provide a nice ambience for a relaxing evening, we can provide you with a few options for your burning needs. Our firewood is split and seasoned between six to twelve months, which means there is little moisture content in the firewood. Not only is it easier to build a fire, but it also won't result in an excess of creosote buildup.

Unseasoned, or green, firewood is wood that has been newly cut and contains mostly water in its fibers. The large amount of moisture in green firewood prevents the fire from getting hot and increases the humidity in the wood exhaust. The moisture in the firewood exhaust condenses at temperatures below 250 degrees to form creosote, a black, sticky, tar-like substance that will burn and produces temperatures exceeding 2,000 degrees!


## What we sell

### Madrona
Madrona is considered to be one of the best firewoods here in the west coast. It is typically found within 100 miles of the ocean and saltwater inlets and quite intolerant of shade. Due to its vigorous growth and tolerance of briny water, it inhabits harsh terrains that is hard for other trees to grow.

Madrona is a tight grained and very hard wood. It burns long and hot and produces less ash than other hardwoods. It usually flames for about 20 to 30 minutes, then it starts to burn like coal with red hot embers that can last quite long. Because of these features, Madrona is a prized firewood that only exists in our part of the United States.

### Douglas Fir
Douglas fir is readily available in Western Washington and is the common type of conifer in this area. It is adapted to grow in moist, mild climates and is the primary source of firewood due to its availability. It can easily be identified due to its red orange tinge interior and thick bark.

Although considered a softwood, Douglas fir burns hot and produces a significant amount of heat, comparable to some hardwoods. Contrary to popular beliefs that softwood causes creosote, properly seasoned Douglas fir firewood results in very little creosote due to the high heat it produces.
